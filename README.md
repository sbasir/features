# sbasir/features

A collection of high-quality, minimal, and reproducible Dev Container Features for personal and professional development environments.

These features are designed to be:

- Simple -- no magic, no surprises --
- Predictable -- reproducible builds, no hidden dependencies --
- User-centric -- everything runs as the correct remoteUser --
- Composable -- works cleanly with official Dev Container features --
- Fast -- minimal install footprint, no unnecessary packages --

If you're building devcontainers and want a clean, opinionated set of features that "just work", this repo is for you.

# 📢 Available Features

### 1. ChezMoi Bootstrap (chezmoi/)

Installs chezmoi and optionally initializes a dotfiles repo for the remoteUser.

Highlights:

- Installs chezmoi into /usr/local/bin
- Supports shorthand (sbasir), user/repo, or full URL
- Automatically rewrites GitHub SSH | HTTPS (ensures reproducible builds without SSH keys)
- Runs chezmoi init as the correct user
- Fully compatible with nested git repos inside dotfiles

Example use:

``jsoncs
"features": {
  "ghcr.io/sbasir/features/chezmoi:1": {
    "repo": "sbasir",
    "apply": true
  }
}
```

## 2. GitHub Known Hosts (github-known-hosts/)

Adds GitHub’s SSH host keys to known_hosts for root, remoteUser, or both (default).

Useful when you want SSH-based Git operations inside the container without MITM warnings.

Example use:

``cjsonc
"features": {
  "ghcr.io/sbasir/features/github-known-hosts:1": {
    "addForRoot": true,
    "addForRemoteUser": true
  }
}
```
